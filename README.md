"The CED file has been absent from the EBTG switch since May 24th. I was informed that the CED file did not arrive, resulting in the job being abended via email on May 25th (Saturday). Despite my initial response on May 27th (Monday) assuring investigation, the matter was reiterated through another email on the same day. As May 27th was an onsite holiday, I was unable to engage with the relevant individual. Furthermore, my attention was diverted towards resolving multiple high-priority issues at the time. Now that I have successfully addressed the problem, I will ensure it is managed effectively going forward. Although encountering this issue for the first time in EBTG, I have gained valuable insight into its resolution."
Suddenly, he invited me to a meeting with Maja, who is the FITB manager. He mentioned that there was an issue with the posting file, but Maja immediately interrupted him, saying that it was not an issue. She explained that the dev team is working on a fix and they need the soft post file and the hold file. During the call with the manager, they didn't ask anything; it was just a conversation between Maja and Mani. Later, he asked for the FITB project details, and I provided them in an email. Then, he called a meeting with just me and Mani to ask about the format of the posting file and other details. I informed him that I would check and send it to him, but he scolded me unnecessarily. I have already provided all the details; he can check the database himself. Also, he does not need these details because he is only going to work on the soft post, which is different. I have enough knowledge to work on the project, which is why I have been managing it since January.


I have not been working on the Amex testing project since last November. Eswar is now handling the project. They will send emails to me, Mani, and Eswar. Eswar will respond to the emails, and if he faces any issues, he will consult with me or Mani.


The Santander team sent an email to our offshore team requesting a file. I noticed that Mani replied in a short span of time, stating he would provide the requested information without checking with me, even though I was the one who worked on the project.

For the last month, I have took leave only for half-a-day on 28th May with the prior notice. Also, there were no meeting scheduled during this time. 
I do update the OOO status on my teams as a standard practice to get the clients/team be aware
