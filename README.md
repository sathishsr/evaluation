1. RNBK Switch Flow
	•	Could you please confirm who approved the RNBK Switch flow? Kindly share the relevant email threads or supporting documentation for reference.
	•	For context, the switch is related to CERT, and the only reports created so far are the ones they are expecting.
	•	The test run is scheduled for August 2025, and all involved teams are currently working on their respective parts.
	•	I’ve attached the document listing the reports CERT is expecting.
	•	Please forward the meeting invite related to the RNBK switch setup to the Offline CERT team. Eswar has already shared the invite—kindly check and confirm.

2. Control Card Setup
	•	It appears several jobs are still referencing Beta control cards instead of Production. Please share any related communications.
	•	As discussed with Mary, the control cards have now been updated in Beta. If more details are needed, we can follow up accordingly.

3. Scheduler Configuration
	•	Currently, no jobs are running in the scheduler for RNBK, and the setup appears incomplete.
	•	As mentioned earlier, the test run is planned for August. Other teams are still working on their parts—DN files are not yet ready, and some control cards are still in progress.
