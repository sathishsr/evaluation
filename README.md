"The CED file has been absent from the EBTG switch since May 24th. I was informed that the CED file did not arrive, resulting in the job being abended via email on May 25th (Saturday). Despite my initial response on May 27th (Monday) assuring investigation, the matter was reiterated through another email on the same day. As May 27th was an onsite holiday, I was unable to engage with the relevant individual. Furthermore, my attention was diverted towards resolving multiple high-priority issues at the time. Now that I have successfully addressed the problem, I will ensure it is managed effectively going forward. Although encountering this issue for the first time in EBTG, I have gained valuable insight into its resolution."
Recently, I was unexpectedly invited to a meeting with Maja, the FITB manager. During the meeting, a concern about the posting file was raised. However, Maja immediately clarified that it was not an issue and informed us that the development team is already working on a fix, requiring the soft post file and the hold file.

During the call with the manager, there were no questions directed to me, as the discussion was primarily between Maja and Mani. Later, he requested the FITB project details, which I promptly provided via email. He then called a meeting with just Mani and me to ask about the format of the posting file and other specifics. I assured him that I would verify and send the information to him, but he seemed frustrated and expressed his dissatisfaction.

I believe I have already supplied all the necessary details, which can also be verified in the database. Additionally, he may not require these specifics since his focus will be on the soft post, which is a different aspect. I have been managing this project since January due to my familiarity and expertise with it, and I am confident in my ability to continue doing so effectively.


I have not been working on the Amex testing project since last November. Eswar is now handling the project. They will send emails to me, Mani, and Eswar. Eswar will respond to the emails, and if he faces any issues, he will consult with me or Mani.


The Santander team sent an email to our offshore team requesting a file. I noticed that Mani replied in a short span of time, stating he would provide the requested information without checking with me, even though I was the one who worked on the project.

For the last month, I have took leave only for half-a-day on 28th May with the prior notice. Also, there were no meeting scheduled during this time. 
I do update the OOO status on my teams as a standard practice to get the clients/team be aware
